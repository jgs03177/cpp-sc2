[![Build Status](https://github.com/cpp-sc2/cpp-sc2/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/cpp-sc2/cpp-sc2/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

The StarCraft II API provides access to in-game state observation and unit control. The API is a wrapper around protobuf defined protocol over a websocket connection.  
While it's possible to write directly to the protocol, this library provides a C++ and class-based abstraction. You can see a simple example below.


## Documentation
* A detailed tutorial is located in [docs/tutorial1.md](docs/tutorial1.md).  
* The API documentation can be found on our [github pages site](https://cpp-sc2.github.io/cpp-sc2). The documentation is generated from code automatically, using [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/)
* For example of usage of this API please refer to [CommandCenter](https://github.com/cpp-sc2/commandcenter), [Suvorov bot](https://github.com/alkurbatov/suvorov-bot) and the [examples](https://github.com/cpp-sc2/cpp-sc2/tree/master/examples) folder in this project.
* To start from scratch, please check this [boilerplate](https://github.com/cpp-sc2/blank-bot).


## Precompiled Libraries
You can download precompiled libraries for Windows and OS X [here](docs/precompiled_libs.md).


## Support

Also, please consider to support this project on [Boosty](https://boosty.to/cpp-sc2) (preferred) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/cppsc2). Support of the project allows to make releases more often and implement nice new features for developers.


## Building the project
This library uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) to generate project files. It builds with [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) on Windows and Makefiles on the other platforms. It relies on the following contrib packages:

1. Civetweb
2. Protobuf
3. (optional) SDL
4. ipv6-parse

Follow the instructions for submodules and building in [docs/building.md](docs/building.md).
